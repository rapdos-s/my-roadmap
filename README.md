<h1>Time to Backend!</h1>

<h2>OS and General Knowledge</h2>

Operating System is a program that manages a computer’s resources, especially the allocation of those resources among other programs. Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections.

<h3>How OSs work in General</h3>

##

<h3>Process Management</h3>

Process management involves various tasks like creation, scheduling, termination of processes, and a deadlock. Process is a program that is under execution, which is an important part of modern-day operating systems. The OS must allocate resources that enable processes to share and exchange information. It also protects the resources of each process from other methods and allows synchronization among processes.

</details>

##

<h3>Threads and Concurrency</h3>

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS. In most modern operating systems, a thread exists within a process - that is, a single process may contain multiple threads.

Concurrency refers to the execution of multiple threads at the same time. It occurs in an operating system when multiple process threads are executing concurrently. These threads can interact with one another via shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in resource sharing, which causes issues like deadlocks and resource scarcity. It aids with techniques such as process coordination, memory allocation, and execution schedule to maximize throughput.

Working within the terminal is common practice for any Backend Developer and there are many commands and utilities that can help you achieve your tasks more efficiently.

The best way to learn these commands is to practice them in your own machine/environment. Specifically, these are related to Linux commands/utilities which are the most prevalent in the market.

To understand these commands, read through the manual pages by using ```man``` command e.g. ```man grep```, ```man awk``` etc.

After enough exposure and practice to these commands, it will become easier to use these in practice

<h3>Memory Management</h3>

The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.

To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. There are several memory management methods, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.

<h2>Version Control Systems</h2>

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.

<h2>Relational Databases</h2>

A relational database is ```a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another```. Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections between the tables are specified as foreign keys. A foreign key is a unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.

<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>

NoSQL databases offer data storage and retrieval that is modelled differently to "traditional" relational databases. NoSQL databases typically focus more on horizontal scaling, eventual consistency, speed and flexibility and is used commonly for big data and real-time streaming applications. NoSQL is often described as a BASE system (```B```asically ```A```vailable, ```S```oft state, ```E```ventual consistency) as opposed to SQL/relational which typically focus on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Common NoSQL data structures include key-value pair, wide column, graph and document.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

<h3>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</h3>

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service aims to provide high availability and performance improvements of websites. This is achieved with fast delivery of website assets and content typically via geographically closer endpoints to the client requests. Traditional commercial CDNs (Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, CloudFlare and Fastly) provide servers across the globe which can be used for this purpose. Serving assets and contents via a CDN reduces bandwidth on website hosting, provides an extra layer of caching to reduce potential outages and can improve website security as well

<h3>Flutter</h3>

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).
Flutter consists of two important parts:
- An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).
- A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs. To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.
Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.
If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.

<h2>Web Assembly</h2>

WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.
Web Assembly or WASM is the binary instructions generated from higher level languages such as Go, C, C++ or Rust. It is faster than JavaScript and WASM 1.0 has already shipped in the major browsers.
W3C accepted it as an official standard at the end of 2019. It will still take quite some time to go mainstream though.

<h1>Turning Back to the Backend!</h1>

<h2>Testing</h2>

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

<h3>Integration Testing</h3>

Integration testing a broad category of tests where multiple software modules are ```integrated``` and tested as a group. It is meant to test the ```interaction``` between multiple services, resources, or modules. For example, an API's interaction with a backend service, or a service with a database.

##

<h3>Unit Testing</h3>

Unit testing is where individual ```units``` (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) of software are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.

##

<h3>Functional Testing</h3>

Functional testing is where software is tested to ensure functional requirements are met. Usually, it is a form of black box testing in which the tester has no understanding of the source code; testing is performed by providing input and comparing expected/actual output. It contrasts with non-functional testing, which includes performance, load, scalability, and penetration testing.

<h3>Domain Driven Design</h3>

##

<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>

Test driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests for software's requirements which will fail until the software is developed to meet those requirements. Once those tests pass, then the cycle repeats to refactor code or develop another feature/requirement. In theory, this ensures that software is written to meet requirements in the simplest form, and avoids code defects.

<h3>KISS</h3>

Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) is a software design principle that states avoiding needless complexity is the best way to build software that is easier to maintain, understand, and contains fewer defects. A simple product that does a single thing well is better than a complex product that does many things poorly.

<h3>YAGNI</h3>

You Aren't Going to Need It (YAGNI) is a software design principle from the Extreme Programming (XP) framework that states when developing software, functionality or features should not be added until they are necessary. Within agile software development in general, requirements are always open to change; any extra functionality may end up being wasted time and resources.

<h3>DRY</h3>

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software design principle which encourages developers to not repeat software patterns or code. DRY encourages code reusability, often in the form of methods, functions, or subroutines. When DRY is implemented successfully, developers are able to make one change to update many related elements while avoiding making changes to unrelated elements.

<h3>Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling</h3>

Horizontal scaling is a change in the ```number``` of a resource. For example, increasing the number of virtual machines processing messages in a queue. Vertical scaling is a change in the ```size/power``` of a resource. For example, increasing the memory or disk space available to a machine. Scaling can be applied to databases, cloud resources, and other areas of computing.
